# Student Management System

## Project Overview

The Student Management System is designed to streamline administrative tasks, facilitate communication between teachers and students, and provide a comprehensive platform for managing academic activities. It caters to the needs of administrative staff, teachers, and students at FAST NUCES.

## Features
* Course registration
* Attendance tracking
* Grade management
* Fee generation
* Transcript generation

## System Architecture
The system is designed with a layered architecture:

* **User Interface Layer:** Provides the GUI for user interaction.
* **Application Logic Layer:** Contains the business rules and functionalities.
* **Data Management Layer:** Manages data storage and retrieval.
* **External Interfaces Layer:** Handles interactions with external systems.

## Design Considerations

* **Hardware Compatibility:** Compatible with standard hardware supporting Windows OS[cite: 116].
* **File System:** Requires a stable file system with necessary permissions[cite: 117].
* **Localization:** Designed to accommodate future localization[cite: 117].
* **Technological Evolution:** Flexible for integration with database systems[cite: 118].
* **Operating System Updates:** Designed to minimize impacts from OS updates[cite: 119].
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Allows for easy updates to security protocols[cite: 120].
* **User Interface Trends:** Separated GUI layer for redesigning UI[cite: 121].
* **Documentation:** Includes thorough documentation for future development[cite: 122].
